Project 1 for Coding Bootcamp

# Concept
Getaway Planner is a web application designed to help the user find the best places to eat and drink (micro-breweries) in whatever town you plan on travelling to within the United States, while giving the weather forecast as well. 

Using this appliction will eliminate the use of different google search tabs, attempting to find restaurants or breweries, and will return all searches within one page. It will also keep a history or recently searched cities for easy access to previously viewed destinations.

The user of this app would be someone who would like to plan a trip to a different city, and would like to find places in which to eat and drink ahead of the trip, while being able to check the weather conditions for the following week. 

The application works by searching a city and state. Once the user submits the search using the search button, results will display and leave a search history list behind, even after refresh. 

# Process
Getaway Planner uses Zomato, OpenBreweryDB, and OpenWeatherMap APIs to get accurate information based on the users City and State inputs. 
Omar - HTML, CSS (Bulma) and linking APIs
Paul - OpenBreweryDB and Search History
James - Zomato
Will - OpenWeatherMap

# Future Upgrades
- Allow the user to search worldwide instead of USA only. 
- Make input easier for the user when searching the city and state by expanding different accepted inputs (state abbreviations, account for accidental spacing, lowercase searching).
- Save individual food and drink entries from multiple cities.
- Option to filter food by type of cuisine.
- Option to search outside of only micro-breweries.
- Option to switch between 8 day forecast and 24 hour hourly forecast.
